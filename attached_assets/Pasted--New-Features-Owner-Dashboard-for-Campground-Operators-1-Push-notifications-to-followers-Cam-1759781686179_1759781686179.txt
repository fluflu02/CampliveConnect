🧭 New Features – Owner Dashboard (for Campground Operators)
1. Push notifications to followers

Campground owners should be able to send push or browser notifications to all users who follow their campground.
Examples:

“New availability update”

“Special event this weekend”

2. Availability forecast (next 7 nights)

Owners should be able to set and update the expected availability for the next 7 nights, per category (e.g., tents, campers, bungalows).
Example:

Today: 30% available

Tomorrow: 60%

Day after tomorrow: 80%

3. 0% availability

The system must allow setting 0% availability, indicating that the campground (or a specific category) is fully booked.

4. Claim campground listing

Owners should be able to claim an existing campground that was uploaded by a user.

Process:

A button “Claim this campground” appears on each campground detail page.

The owner provides their official campground email or website, and receives a verification code to confirm ownership.

After successful verification, the campground is linked to the owner’s account.

On the map and detail page, display a badge: “✅ Verified Owner”.

5. Notification when a favorite campground becomes available

Users should be able to opt in to receive notifications when one of their favorite campgrounds (those they follow) reports new availability.

Users can enable or disable this feature in their profile.

When the owner updates availability (via the 7-night forecast), a push or email notification is automatically sent to interested users.
Example notification:

“Good news! Your favorite campground Camping Bernina has new availability.”

6. Special announcements / events

Owners should be able to publish special announcements, promotions, or events directly on their campground page.
Examples:

“Summer Festival on July 14th”

“Last available spots for the weekend!”
These announcements appear on the campground detail page, visible to all visitors.
Optionally, a push notification can also be sent to followers.
